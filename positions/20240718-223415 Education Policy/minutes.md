## Minutes of the Meeting

Head of Foreign Affairs

*As we discuss education policy, it's crucial to consider the international perspective and how our decisions will impact Lithuania's standing in the global arena. While I appreciate the focus on domestic educational reforms, **we must also prioritize international collaborations and exchange programs in AI and technology fields**. This will not only enhance our students' skills but also position Lithuania as a forward-thinking nation in the global tech landscape. By fostering these international connections, we can attract foreign expertise, promote our own talent abroad, and ensure our education system remains competitive on the world stage.*

Head of Economy

*Given the focus on education policy in this meeting, it's crucial to emphasize the importance of aligning our educational system with the needs of our evolving AI-driven economy. **We must prioritize the integration of AI and technology-focused curricula at all levels of education to ensure our workforce remains competitive in the global market.** This approach will not only foster innovation and entrepreneurship among our youth but also attract tech investments to Lithuania, positioning us as a leader in the digital economy. While I respect the perspectives shared by other participants, I believe that investing in AI education is fundamental to our economic growth and future prosperity.*

Head of Transport

*As we discuss education policy, it's crucial to consider the integration of transportation and education systems. **Smart, AI-driven transportation solutions can significantly enhance access to educational opportunities across Lithuania, particularly in rural areas.** By implementing efficient and sustainable public transport networks, we can ensure that students from all backgrounds have equal access to schools and universities. Additionally, incorporating transportation-related technologies into the curriculum could foster innovation and prepare students for future careers in this rapidly evolving sector.*

Head of Education

*As we discuss our education policy, it's crucial that we focus on integrating AI and technology into our curriculum while ensuring accessibility for all Lithuanian students. **We must strike a balance between innovation and inclusivity.** While I agree with the proposal to introduce coding classes from an early age, we should also consider how to support students who may not have access to advanced technology at home. Perhaps we could explore partnerships with tech companies to provide necessary resources and training for teachers to effectively deliver these new programs.*
