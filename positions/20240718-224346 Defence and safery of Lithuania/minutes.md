## Minutes of the Meeting

Head of Foreign Affairs

*In light of the current discussion on Lithuania's defense and safety, it's crucial that we leverage our nation's growing expertise in AI and technology to bolster our security measures. While I agree with the emphasis on cybersecurity mentioned earlier, we must also consider the diplomatic aspects of our defense strategy. **We should actively pursue international partnerships and collaborations in AI-driven defense technologies, particularly with our NATO allies and EU partners.** This approach not only enhances our defensive capabilities but also positions Lithuania as a key player in the global AI and tech landscape, potentially attracting investment and fostering innovation in our defense sector.*

Head of Economy

*As we discuss the defense and safety of Lithuania, it's crucial to consider the economic implications of our strategies. **Integrating AI and advanced technologies into our defense systems not only enhances our national security but also presents significant opportunities for economic growth and innovation.** By investing in AI-driven defense solutions, we can attract tech investments, create high-skilled jobs, and position Lithuania as a leader in cybersecurity and defense technology. This approach aligns with our goal of fostering a tech-friendly economy while ensuring the safety of our citizens.*

Head of Transport

*As we discuss the defence and safety of Lithuania, it's crucial to consider how our transportation infrastructure plays a vital role in national security. **Smart, AI-integrated transportation systems can significantly enhance our ability to respond to potential threats and emergencies.** By implementing advanced traffic management systems and developing a robust network of autonomous vehicles, we can ensure rapid deployment of resources and efficient evacuation procedures if needed. Moreover, enhancing our national and international connectivity through modernized transportation links can strengthen our strategic position within the region and NATO alliance.*

Head of Education

*As we discuss the defence and safety of Lithuania, it's crucial to consider the role of education in strengthening our national security. **By integrating AI and cybersecurity education into our curriculum, we can cultivate a generation of tech-savvy citizens who are better equipped to defend our digital borders and contribute to innovative defence solutions.** This approach not only enhances our military capabilities but also creates a more resilient society overall, capable of identifying and responding to emerging threats in the digital age. While I agree with the importance of modernizing our military equipment, as mentioned by some colleagues, I believe that investing in human capital through education is equally, if not more, critical for our long-term security and prosperity.*
