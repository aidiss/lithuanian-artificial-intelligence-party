## Minutes of the Meeting

Head of Economy

*Given the crucial role of technology and innovation in driving economic growth, I propose we focus on metrics that measure our progress in the digital economy. While I agree with the importance of traditional indicators like GDP and employment rates, we should also consider **metrics such as the number of AI startups, the percentage of workforce employed in tech sectors, and the rate of AI adoption across industries**. These indicators would provide valuable insights into our success in positioning Lithuania as a tech-friendly economy and attracting investments in emerging technologies, which are key to our long-term economic competitiveness and growth.*

Head of Justice

*While I appreciate the focus on economic metrics suggested by some, we must not overlook the critical importance of justice-related indicators in measuring a country's progress. **A truly advanced society is one where the rule of law is upheld, civil liberties are protected, and access to justice is equitable for all citizens.** I propose we include metrics such as the efficiency of the court system, public trust in the judiciary, and the effectiveness of anti-corruption measures as key indicators of national well-being and development. These factors not only reflect the strength of our democratic institutions but also directly impact economic growth and social stability.*

Minister of Agriculture

*Considering the vital role of agriculture in Lithuania's economy and food security, I propose we prioritize metrics that reflect both agricultural productivity and sustainability. While I agree with the importance of GDP and educational attainment mentioned by others, we must also focus on indicators such as **agricultural yield per hectare, percentage of land under sustainable farming practices, and rural employment rates**. These metrics will help us gauge the health of our agricultural sector, ensure food security for our citizens, and promote environmentally responsible farming methods that will safeguard our natural resources for future generations.*

Head of Education

*As we discuss the most important metrics for our country, I believe we must prioritize measures that reflect our educational system's ability to prepare students for the AI-driven future. While I appreciate the economic focus mentioned by some colleagues, **we should consider metrics such as digital literacy rates, the percentage of schools offering AI and programming courses, and the number of graduates in STEM fields** as crucial indicators of our nation's progress. These metrics will not only gauge our educational success but also our readiness to compete in the global technology landscape, ensuring Lithuania's future prosperity and innovation potential.*

Head of Health

*Taking into account the vital importance of public health for the overall well-being and productivity of our nation, I propose we prioritize metrics that reflect the accessibility and quality of healthcare services, such as average life expectancy, infant mortality rates, and wait times for essential medical procedures. Additionally, we should consider metrics that measure the prevalence of preventable diseases and the effectiveness of our health education programs. **These indicators will not only provide a comprehensive view of our nation's health status but also guide our efforts in developing targeted policies to address key health challenges and improve the overall quality of life for all Lithuanian citizens.***

Head of Transport

*As we discuss the most important metrics for our country, we must consider the transformative potential of our transportation systems. While economic indicators are crucial, as mentioned by others, we should not overlook the impact of efficient, sustainable, and AI-driven transport on our nation's progress. **I propose we include metrics such as the percentage of AI-integrated traffic management systems, the reduction in carbon emissions from transport, and the adoption rate of electric and autonomous vehicles.** These indicators will not only reflect our technological advancement but also our commitment to environmental sustainability and improved quality of life for our citizens.*

Minister of Defence

*While economic and social metrics are undoubtedly crucial, **we must not overlook the paramount importance of national security indicators in ensuring the long-term stability and prosperity of our nation**. Measures such as military readiness, defence spending as a percentage of GDP, and the technological advancement of our armed forces are vital metrics that directly impact our ability to safeguard our sovereignty and contribute meaningfully to international peacekeeping efforts. Furthermore, these metrics are closely intertwined with our economic and social well-being, as a secure nation is better positioned to attract investment, foster innovation, and maintain the quality of life for its citizens.*

Head of Energy

*While I acknowledge the importance of economic metrics like GDP and employment rates, as mentioned by other participants, I believe we must prioritize metrics that reflect our energy transition and environmental sustainability. **We should focus on indicators such as the percentage of renewable energy in our total energy mix, carbon emissions per capita, and energy efficiency improvements across sectors.** These metrics not only align with our party's commitment to addressing climate change but also serve as crucial indicators of our progress towards energy independence and long-term sustainability, which are vital for Lithuania's future prosperity and security.*

Head of Culture

*In light of our party's core principles and the importance of cultural cohesion, I propose we consider metrics that reflect our society's well-being beyond mere economic indicators. While GDP and employment rates are crucial, we should also measure **cultural engagement, social trust, and citizen satisfaction with democratic processes**. These metrics would provide a more holistic view of our nation's progress and align with our party's commitment to fostering a strong, unified Lithuanian identity in the age of AI. By tracking these aspects, we can ensure our policies not only drive economic growth but also nurture the cultural fabric that binds our society together.*

Head of Foreign Affairs

*As we consider the most important metrics for our country, we must not overlook the critical role of international cooperation and diplomatic influence in the global AI landscape. While domestic indicators are undoubtedly crucial, as mentioned by other participants, I propose we also measure Lithuania's engagement in international AI initiatives, partnerships with leading tech nations, and our country's reputation in global AI ethics discussions. **These metrics will not only reflect our progress in foreign affairs but also contribute significantly to our overall technological advancement and economic growth.** By tracking our participation in international AI forums, the number of bilateral tech agreements signed, and our country's ranking in global AI readiness indices, we can ensure Lithuania remains at the forefront of the global AI revolution while fostering positive relationships with our international partners.*

Head of Interior

*While I appreciate the focus on economic and technological metrics proposed by some colleagues, we must not overlook the critical importance of metrics related to public safety and national security. **I strongly advocate for including indicators such as crime rates, emergency response times, and citizen trust in law enforcement as key metrics for our country's well-being.** These measures not only reflect the effectiveness of our interior policies but also contribute significantly to the overall quality of life and stability of our nation. Furthermore, we should consider metrics that assess our ability to integrate immigrants and maintain social cohesion, as these factors are crucial for long-term national prosperity and security.*

Minister of Finance

*As we consider the most important metrics for our country, we must not overlook the critical importance of **fiscal health and economic stability**. While I appreciate the Education Minister's focus on educational outcomes and the Health Minister's emphasis on healthcare accessibility, I believe that a strong economic foundation is essential to support all other national priorities. We should closely monitor indicators such as GDP growth, inflation rates, unemployment figures, and debt-to-GDP ratio to ensure we maintain a robust economy that can fund our educational and healthcare initiatives, as well as other crucial public services.*

Head of Social Security and Labour

*In light of our party's commitment to social welfare and labor rights, I believe we should prioritize metrics that reflect the well-being of our workforce and the effectiveness of our social security systems. While I agree with the Finance Minister's emphasis on economic indicators, we must not overlook measures such as **income inequality, job satisfaction, and access to social services**. These metrics provide crucial insights into the quality of life for our citizens and the inclusivity of our economic growth. Furthermore, I'd like to build on the Education Minister's point about lifelong learning by suggesting we track metrics related to workforce adaptability and reskilling programs, as these will be vital in ensuring our labor force remains competitive in an AI-driven economy.*
