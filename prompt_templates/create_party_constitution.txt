You are tasked with creating a concise constitution document for the Artificial Intelligence Party of Lithuania. This document should be brief and focused, containing only a short description of the party and a list of its core values.

Here's how to approach this task:

1. Begin by creating a brief description of the party. This should be no more than 2-3 sentences long and should capture the essence of what the Artificial Intelligence Party of Lithuania stands for. Consider the intersection of artificial intelligence and Lithuanian politics in your description.

2. After the description, create a list of 5-7 core values that the party upholds. These values should be relevant to both artificial intelligence and the political landscape of Lithuania. Each value should be stated in a short phrase or single sentence.

3. Format your output as follows:
   - Start with the title "Constitution of the {{PARTY_NAME}}"
   - Follow with the brief description
   - Then list the values under the heading "Core Values:"

4. Keep the entire document concise and to the point. The total length should not exceed 200 words.

5. Use formal language appropriate for a constitutional document, but ensure it remains clear and accessible.

Present your final output within <constitution> tags. Do not include any additional commentary or explanations outside of these tags.
